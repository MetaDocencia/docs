## Why?

We were born on March 16th, 2020 out of the need to move university classes online fast in Argentina during the COVID-19 pandemic and our intention to do our part to help in this situation. 

## Our mission and what we offer

We aim to share practical tools to help teachers to teach online. We teach online synchronous [workshops](https://metadocencia.netlify.app/cursos/). We designed these workshops with higher education teachers in mind, but instructors teaching in other levels and students who want to collaborate in the classes can also participate.

Our virtual courses are short and centered in the design of materials and classroom management to maximise students' learning without anyone getting exhausted. 
	
All our courses are free and our materials are [openly licensed](LICENCE.md). That is, you can reuse or edit any material, with the condition that you include a reference to our [website](https://metadocencia.netlify.com/) in any material you generate by reusing our content.

Our courses help to improve the learning process both in in-person and online classes. We use modern, evidence-based teaching techniques that improve educational outcomes. 

In addition, we aim to create a cross-disciplinary knowledge-sharing teaching community. We know, and the evidence also supports, that better results are obtained when we teach together.

## What we **don't** offer

* In-depth courses. Our courses are all introductory.
* Theoretical contents. Our courses are 100% practical.
* Certificates of any kind.

## Which model do we follow

We are guided by these teaching principles:

* Be kind: all else is details.
* Remember that you are not your learner...
* ...that most people would rather fail than change...
* ...and that ninety percent of magic consists of knowing one extra thing.
* Never teach alone.
* Never hesitate to sacrifice truth for clarity.
* Make every mistake a lesson.
* Remember that no lesson survives the first contact with learners...
* ...that every lesson is too short for the teacher and too long for the learner...
* ...and that nobody will be excited about the lesson than you are.

We follow this [code of conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

These principles arise from the experience of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org), which has been training teachers for two decades and are developed in the free book [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/).

Part of our course materials are based on [RStudio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/) materials.
