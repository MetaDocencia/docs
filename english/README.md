## Why?

We were born on March 16, 2020 out of the need to virtualize university classes very quickly in Argentina during the COVID19 pandemic and our intention to do our part to help in this situation. 

## Our mission and what we offer

We aim to share practical tools to help those dedicated to teaching with the virtualization of their classes. We give onine in-person courses (also called synchronous online courses). We design these courses with higher level teachers in mind (tertiary/university) but teachers of other levels and students who want to collaborate in the classes can also participate.

Our virtual courses are short and centerd in the design of materials and classroom management to maximise students' learning without anyone getting too tired. 
	
All our courses are free and our materials are [openly licensed](LICENCE.md). That is, you can reuse or edit any material, with the sole condition that you include a reference to our [website](https://metadocencia.netlify.app/) in any material you generate by reusing our content.

Our courses help to improve the learning process in face-to-face and distance classes. We use modern, evidence-based teaching techniques that improve educational outcomes. 

In addition, we aim to create a cross-disciplinary knowledge-sharing teaching community. We know, and the evidence also supports, that better results are obtained when we teach in community.

## What we **don't** offer

* In-depth courses. Our courses are all introductory.
* Theoretical contents. Our courses are 100% practical.
* Certificates of any kind.

## Which model do we follow

We are guided by these teaching principles:

* Be kind: everything else is details.
* Remember that you are not your student...
* ... that most people would rather fail than change ...
* ... and that ninety percent of magic consists of knowing only one thing more (than your audience).
* Never teach alone.
* Never hesitate to sacrifice truth for clarity.
* Make every mistake a lesson.
* Remember that no class material survives the first contact with students ...
* ... that each class is too short for the one who teaches and too long for the one who receives it...
* ...and no one will be more enthusiastic about your class than you.

We follow this [code of conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

These principles arise from the experience of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org), which has been training teachers for two decades and are developed in the free book [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/).
